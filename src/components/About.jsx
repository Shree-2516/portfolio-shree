        <p>
          I'm Shreeyash Paraj, a third-year B.Tech engineering student with a passion for crafting functional, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy exploring full-stack development and have hands-on experience with technologies like Python, Java, Flask, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQLite.
Some of my notable projects include a Trading Journal App for tracking and analyzing trades, a Student CRUD system for managing academic records, and this very portfolio siteâ€”built using Reactâ€”to showcase my work and skills. I'm constantly learning and love turning ideas into live, working solutions.
